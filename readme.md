## Introduce
This project was previously written, was used for low version of the bot attack defense, but because our 1.5.2 Minecraft server is not open, and then only a few small updates.

Note: This is the previous project, the code level is not high.
## Feature
Can be used for defense:
- Fast/slow/bypass bot attacks (single ip)
- Distributed bot attacks
- motd attack
- Play normally while being attacked
## Performance indicators:
The following are all test results for 1.8.8.
### 1000bot/s attack
- 1Core 2G lagging
- 3Core 6G smooth
- 4Core 8G Smooth
### 5000bot/s attack
- 1Core 2G disaster(server crash)
- 4Core 8G Last ten seconds of the attack lagged (total 30s)
